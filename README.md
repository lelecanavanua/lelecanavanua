  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of programming and especially Front-end languages. Projects are uploaded for review.
  - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Boxing, Adventure Racing and tropical island living.
  - âš¡ Fun fact: I once met President Barack Obama (During his 2nd term). I shook his hand and got it all on video.
